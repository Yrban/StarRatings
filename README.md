# StarRatings
This is a view to show, and change, ratings in stars.

This view will take a rating as a Double, correct it to either end in .0 or .5, and subsequently display that rating with filled, half-filled or unfilled stars. One can set an essentially unlimited amount of stars for the rating, with a minimum of 1. 

The rating can be changed by dragging the last rated star either right or left, due to a transparant slider that sits above the stars, and changes the rating in half star steps.
